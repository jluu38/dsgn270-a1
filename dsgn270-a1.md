The Glenbow Museum is one of many central hubs for Calgary's arts communities. Functioning as an archive and gallery for researchers and attendees, the Glenbow's website should reflect the institution's mission while remaining easy to navigate.

From the Glenbow's [about page](https://www.glenbow.org/about):
>We are committed to expanding the accessibility and impact of art and culture in our community through exhibitions and programs that provide meaningful experiences for all visitors.

The directory in particular satisfices all users who are looking for the Glenbow's address, hours, or phone number because that information is available on *every* page.
