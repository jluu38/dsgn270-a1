# Website Critique: [Glenbow](https://www.glenbow.org/)

## Overview
Functioning as both archive and gallery, researchers and art enthusiasts are among those who are expected to visit the Glenbow Museum. With COVID-19, the Glenbow has also taken to social media and their website to offer [Glenbow From Home](https://www.glenbow.org/whats-on/?time-range=week&filters=128), a collection of educational videos about their current exhibits.

The Glenbow's website must be able to continue accomodating educators and members while also appealing to a new demographic of users.

## Usability
### Conventions
Users with varying purposes will visit the Glenbow website. For this reason, there are two notable conventions on every page:

1. A **fixed navigation bar** that opens *hero menus*.
2. A **directory** at the bottom of each page with a condensed *hero footer*, the museum's physical address, social media, phone number and hours.

Because it is likely users frequently seek the address, hours, and means of contact, the directory satisfices these needs by making this information available on every page.

### Navigation
The Glenbow's navigation is **broad and shallow**. The nested subcategories in the hero menus typically lead to a page, meaning information is often two clicks away. While it may seem like there are many subcategories, the hero menus maintain clarity with certain strategies:

- The hero menus vertically open to cover most of the viewport, removing the need to hover or misclicking the current page
- Subcategories appear in large font sizes, organised in a column on the right-hand side of the hero menus
- Subcategories that offer further options are shifted left into the *negative space* of the hero menus, allowing child subcategories to occupy the former column

  - This use of negative space allows both parent and child subcategories to be visually and logically separated while maintaining the large font size for readability

The website also employs the conventions of **cards** and **search filters** within their *What's On* navigation tab. Instead of creating different pages for current, upcoming, and past exhibits, each subcategory links to the same page with the appropriate search filter already applied.

## Visual Hierarchy
### Scannability
The general content of the website (barring in-depth articles on specific exhibits) is made to be scannable.

For example, the Glenbow's [*About*](https://www.glenbow.org/about) page uses a number of subheadings and short paragraphs to state their values. Beneath their values, it continues:
>### Mission Statement
>Our mission is to activate art, objects, and ideas so everyone who experiences Glenbow leaves with something to share.
>### Glenbow's Vision for the Future
>A museum reimagined.

### Visual Cues
The Glenbow's website is also visually communicative.

- On the main page, a call for submissions is **right-aligned** while the remaining items are **left-aligned**
  - Because this page is formatted like an article list, the single violation in consistent alignment indicates the project's significance
- As an image heavy website, the **size and scale** of cards with image hyperlinks, static images, and videos remain proportionate to their own medium for differentiation
  - Static images are often cropped to horizontally span a page or presented on a *carousel* to act as visual headers, or to punctuate a change in subject within the page
- Categories and their child subcategories are assigned a **colour** on the navigation bar to visually relate individual pages to a category
  - To achieve the same effect within pages, **different fonts** are attached to specific subjects

## Mobile Friendliness
The content on the Glenbow's website is responsive with **two breakpoints**. Unfortunately, these breakpoints are not without issues, such as:
- Content parity, most noticeably with news and exhibit summaries on the main page
- Consistent colours within the new **hamburger menu**
  - While browsing a specific page, its assigned colour from the desktop navigation bar is used to colour the whole hamburger menu instead of being a neutral white
- Images on cards do not scale proportionately and become obscured
- The *What's On* search filters appear awkwardly aligned after the first breakpoint
  - However, the search filters accomodate the second breakpoint and become vertically stacked

## Conclusion
The Glenbow's website sufficiently sorts and presents its vast archive of content with conventions that provide easy navigation. The faults in mobile friendliness do not take away from the content as the issues are mostly cosmetic.
