# Website Critique: [Glenbow](https://www.glenbow.org/)

## Overview
The Glenbow Museum is one of many central hubs for Calgary's arts communities. Functioning as an archive and gallery for researchers and art enthusiasts, the Glenbow's website should achieve its purpose while remaining easy to navigate.

With COVID-19, the Glenbow has taken to social media and their website to offer [Glenbow From Home](https://www.glenbow.org/whats-on/?time-range=week&filters=128). This invites a larger demographic of users that must be accomodated.

## Usability
### Conventions
Users with varying purposes will visit the Glenbow website. For this reason, there are two notable conventions on every page:

1. A **floating navigation bar** with a selection of categories presented on *hero menus*.
2. A **directory** at the bottom of each page with a condensed *hero footer*, but also with the museum's physical address (and a link to Google Maps for directions), phone number and hours.

The directory in particular satisfices all users who are looking for the Glenbow's address, hours, or phone number because that information is available on *every* page.

### Navigation
For the most part, the Glenbow uses broad and shallow navigation. The navigation bar's categories are not overwhelming, and most subcategories lead to a page.
>Some might consider there to be too many subcategories, however the hero menus open to cover most of the viewport. This allows more subcategories that lead directly to pages while keeping the choices readable.

## Visual Hierarchy
The Glenbow's website succeeds with their use of:

- **Size and scale** are used to emphasise exhibits/news while being logically and visually related by **colour**
- Site content is differentiated from exhibit information by having body texts in **different fonts**
- *Cards* with content and news alternate left and right **alignments**
  - Their use of alignment is risky, but it pays off because the noticeable use of size makes it easy to recognise

The points above are done **repetitively** to maintain a consistent visual hierarchy throughout the site.

The general content of the website (barring in-depth articles on specific art pieces and exhibits) is largely scannable.
>For example, the Glenbow's *About* page condenses their [values and mission statement](https://www.glenbow.org/about) into concise subheadings and small paragraphs.


## Mobile Friendliness
While the content *is* responsive, there is an issue of content parity while browsing on mobile; exhibition summaries are removed while preview images are obscured because they do not become resized. 

## Conclusion
The Glenbow's website sufficiently presents and archives a large amount of information with conventions providing simple navigation and a visual hierarchy that
