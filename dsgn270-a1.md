# Website Critique: [Glenbow](https://www.glenbow.org/)

## Overview
The Glenbow Museum is one of many central hubs for Calgary's arts communities. Functioning as an archive and gallery for researchers and attendees, the Glenbow's website should reflect the institution's mission while remaining easy to navigate.

> - Visual Hierarchy
> - Mobile Friendliness

With COVID-19, the Glenbow has taken to social media and their website to showcase exhibitions. This means that a wider range of individuals should be accomodated.

## Usability
Users with varying purposes will visit the Glenbow website. For this reason, every page is equipped with two conventions:

1. A **floating navigation bar** with a selection of categories presented on *hero menus*.
2. A **directory** at the bottom of each page with condensed *hero footer*, but also with the museum's physical address (and a link to Google Maps for directions), phone number and hours.

The directory in particular satisfices all users who are looking for the Glenbow's address, hours, or phone number because that information is available on *every* page.

## Visual Hierarchy
The Glenbow's website succeeds with their use of:

- **Size and scale** are used to emphasise exhibits while being logically and visually related by **colour**
- Site content is differentiated from exhibit information by having its content in a **different font**
- *Cards* with content and news alternate left and right **alignments**

The points above are done **repetitively** to maintain a consistent visual hierarchy throughout the site.

## Mobile Friendliness
There is a small issue with content parity while browsing on mobile; exhibition summaries are removed while preview images are obscured because they do not become resized. 

## Conclusion
The Glenbow's website sufficiently presents and archives a large amount of information with conventions providing simple navigation and a visual hierarchy that
